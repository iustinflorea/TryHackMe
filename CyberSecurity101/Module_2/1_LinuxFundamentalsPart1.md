==============================
pwd, cd, cd .., ls, cat
find -name 
grep

===============================

&	     Runs the command, but does not wait for it to finish before you can do anything else. The command runs in the backgorund, and is helpful for commands that might take a while to complete, or ones that you want to keep        running.
&&	   Runs both commands, but waits for the first command to finish first, before the next. Like a set of dominoes.
>   Used to redirect output. We can take the output of a command and send it to a file. This operator will overwrite anything that exists in the file.
>>	This redirector does the same thing, but instead of overwriting, it will just add the output to the bottom of the file.
