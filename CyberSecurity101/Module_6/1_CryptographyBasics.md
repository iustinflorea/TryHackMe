We have just introduced several new terms, and we need to learn them to understand any text about cryptography. The terms are listed below:

Plaintext is the original, readable message or data before it’s encrypted. It can be a document, an image, a multimedia file, or any other binary data.
Ciphertext is the scrambled, unreadable version of the message after encryption. Ideally, we cannot get any information about the original plaintext except its approximate size.
Cipher is an algorithm or method to convert plaintext into ciphertext and back again. A cipher is usually developed by a mathematician.
Key is a string of bits the cipher uses to encrypt or decrypt data. In general, the used cipher is public knowledge; however, the key must remain secret unless it is the public key in asymmetric encryption. We will visit asymmetric encryption in a later task.
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a cipher and a key. Unlike the key, the choice of the cipher is disclosed.
Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a cipher and a key. Although the cipher would be public knowledge, recovering the plaintext without knowledge of the key should be impossible (infeasible).

The building blocks of modern cryptography lie in mathematics. To demonstrate some basic algorithms, we will cover two mathematical operations that are used in various algorithms:

XOR Operation
Modulo Operation
